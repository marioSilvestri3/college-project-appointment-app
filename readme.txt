Title: Appointment Scheduling and Customer Management Tool

Purpose: This application serves as convenient UI tool for managing appointments and customers stored in a MySQL database. The application loads up into a login screen for user authentication ,and then directed to the home screen. There, appointments and customers can be viewed on a single screen, where they can also be added, modified, or deleted. Adding or modifying an appointment or customer brings up another screen where the user can add or change information. From the home screen the user can also filter appointments coming up in the next week or month, as well as open the reports screen that display additional appointment and scheduling information, as well as a session activity log. The application is localized to English and French languages. The application code is modular so additional localization or databases can be added without needing to modify the main codebase.
